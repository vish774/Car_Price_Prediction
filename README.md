# Car_Price_Prediction

The Problem Statement: 
Project(Car Price Prediction) Based on the features(columns) of the cars(Dataset), we are going to predict the Car Selling_Price(Target Variable).

Description:
This dataset contains information about used cars.

The columns in the given dataset are as follows.

1.car_name ==> Ex:ritz,swift,fiesta...etc

2.year ==> Manufacturing year of the car. Ex: 2007,2018...etc

3.selling_price(Dependent Column)

4.km_driven ==> Number of kilometers the car travelled since manufacture date

5.fuel ==> i.e..Petrol,Diesel& CNG

6.seller_type ==> i.e..Dealer, Individual

7.transmission ==> i.e..Manual, Automatic

8.Owner ==> owner name already converted to 0,1,3


●	Responsibilities:

⮚	Created a new environment to avoid interference in project if any of the packages or libraries get updated in future.

⮚	Collected data from Kaggle.

⮚	Understood the insights of the data by doing extensive EDA by using various plotting techniques with the help of matplotlib and seaborn visualization libraries.

⮚	Performed various feature engineering techniques like handling missing values, cleaning the data, encoding categorical data into numerical data.

⮚	Plotted feature importance plots like Heatmap and ExtraTreeRegressor to find which features are important for the model and to find out the relationship between all the features.

⮚	Further divided the data into train and test splits in the ratio of 80% and 20%.

⮚	Applied various machine learning algorithms on the dataset and performed Hyper Parameter Tuning techniques like GridSearchCV and RandomisedSearchCV to find out the best parameters.

⮚	Saved the model into a pickle file which is also known as Serialization.

⮚	Finally done deployment using flask framework.

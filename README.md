# Car_Price_Prediction

The Problem Statement: 
Project(Car Price Prediction) Based on the features(columns) of the cars(Dataset), we are going to predict the Car Selling_Price(Target Variable).

Description:
This dataset contains information about used cars.

The columns in the given dataset are as follows.

1.car_name ==> Ex:ritz,swift,fiesta...etc

2.year ==> Manufacturing year of the car. Ex: 2007,2018...etc

3.selling_price(Dependent Column)

4.km_driven ==> Number of kilometers the car travelled since manufacture date

5.fuel ==> i.e..Petrol,Diesel& CNG

6.seller_type ==> i.e..Dealer, Individual

7.transmission ==> i.e..Manual, Automatic

8.Owner ==> owner name already converted to 0,1,3
